 The customization of background music is very simple. What you need to do is just call `start` function with `customBGM` parameter.
 */

start(customBGM: /*#-editable-code Bool*/true/*#-end-editable-code*/)

//: If `customBGM` is true, you can choose a song from your music library before the game start.

//: - Note: Maybe you need to stop the background music by tapping the button lying on the right-bottom corner **before** you stop the code running.

//: - Experiment: Try to choose a song.

 Then it is over. It's that simple.
