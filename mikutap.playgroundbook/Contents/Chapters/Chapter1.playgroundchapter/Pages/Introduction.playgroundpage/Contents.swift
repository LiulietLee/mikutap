 # Mikutap
 
 As a developer who loves Hatsune Miku, I was attracted to it when I first saw Mikutap on the web.
  
 Mikutap is a music game originally made by *daniwell*. The entire view in the game is divided into a number of neat little squares, each one corresponds to a pitch and a Japanese syllabary. Touching a square with your finger will send out a corresponding tone and lyrics, and you can form a song melody by sliding continuously. Coupled with a nice set of fingertip animations, it’s just awesome.

 
 Swift is my favorite programming language, and Hatsune Miku is my favorite virtual singer. In order to make two happy things together, I wrote this playground. It is recommended to **turn on the volume** and **horizontal full screen**.
 
 Hope you'll enjoy this playground.
