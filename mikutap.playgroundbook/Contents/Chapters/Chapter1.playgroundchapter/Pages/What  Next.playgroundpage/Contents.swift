 [Previous: Custom Background Music](@previous)
 
 The playground is over here. You can do whatever you want on this page.
 
 There are a lot of things that I didn't talk about. For example, how to draw a circle? How does Metal work? What is the shading language? and many more. If you are interested in these contents, you can check the related documents.
 
 I hope you like this playground. Have a nice day!
